<br/>

<br/>
**Context** – Alex Steven’s and Co. is a cargo company which diversified into the delivery sector with the name Captain Eggy. They commenced operations in October 2020 and engaged me to design a dashboard tracking their operations thus far in December 2020. The Sales Trend Analysis Dashboard gave an overview of every aspect of operations over the three month time frame; product, sales rep and region performance. It contained multiple slicers to enable management to efficiently track individual or multiple aspects of the business and draw conclusions from them. <br/>
